find the minimum number of moves it would require the robot to collect all 
the artifacts given the map of the building. 
These buildings aren't as straightforward as they seem. They have some special 
doors which can be unlocked only if you have the particular artifact required. 
  
Your task: 
You are given a map with the starting position denoted by '@'. 
Walls of the building are denoted by '#'. [ Your bot cannot pass through walls] 
Empty spaces are denoted by '.' 
Artifacts are denoted by small alphabets : 'a', 'd', 'g'. 
The Respective doors are represented by caps of the same letter : 'A', 'D', 'G'. 
i.e. if you have 'a' you can pass through 'A'. Else you cannot pass 'A'. 
Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain all the 
artifacts. 

Since artifacts are really hard to find, you can safely assume that any given building 
and therefore its map won't have more than 7 artifacts. 
Also for every given artifact, its respective door will exist.  
i.e. if artifact 'a' is present, the map will have the door 'A' as well. 

Note: Move is allowed in any of the 4 cardinal directions only. No diagonal 
movements. If you are not able to reach all the artifacts, return -1. 

Example 1:
Map: ["@..a.", 
      "###.#", 
      "b.A.B"] 
Minimum number of moves required = 8 

Example 2:
Map: ["@Aa"] 
Minimum number of moves required = -1 

(Explanation for Example 1:
Start at @ -> move 3 steps right to get 'a' -> move back 1 step left -> move 2 steps down ->
move 1 step left -> pass through door 'A' -> move 1 step right -> collect 'b' = Total 8 moves)

(Explanation for Example 2:
Cannot collect 'a' because it's behind door 'A', which requires artifact 'a' to open - impossible!)
